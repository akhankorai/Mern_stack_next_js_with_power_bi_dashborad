📊 MERN Data Management + Data Cleaning + Power BI Dashboard (Live Shared Report)
📌 Project Overview

This project is an end-to-end MERN stack data management system that collects raw business records through a modern web app, performs data cleaning and preprocessing, and delivers insights through an interactive Power BI dashboard (shared report link).

Users can create, update, and manage records using the React UI, while the Node.js/Express backend stores data in MongoDB. A dedicated data cleaning pipeline removes duplicates, handles missing values, standardizes formats, and prepares structured datasets for analytics. The cleaned dataset is then connected to Power BI, where dashboards provide live reporting and scheduled refresh for decision-making.
